# Placeholder helper for CodeIgniter

This helper allows you to add placeholder images and text in your applications. It is extremely useful when prototyping the layout of the page.

# Usage

`placeholder(width, height, text, bgcolor, color);` - placeholder images

`lipsum(paragraphs, length, extra_options)` - placeholder text

The helper uses [placehold.it](http://placehold.it) and [loripsum.net](http://loripsum.net) services.

## Examples

### Image placeholders

- 300px square: `placeholder(300);`.
- 200x100px rectangular: `placeholder(200, 100);`
- 200x100px rectangular with custom text: `placeholder(200, 100, 'Howdy');`
- 100px black square with white text: `placeholder(100, 100, 'Howdy', '000000', 'FFFFFF');`

Note that colors are represented as HEX values (when passing arguments to the function, don't add the pound `#` symbol).

You can also pass in an array:

`placeholder(array('width' => 100, 'height' => 100, 'text' => 'Howdy', 'background' => '000000', 'foreground' => 'FFFFFF'));`

### Text placeholders

- 2 medium length paragraphs: `lipsum()`
- 3 short paragraphs: `lipsum(3, 'short')`
- 5 long paragraphs with decorations (bold, italic text) and links: `lipsum(3, 'long', array('decorate', 'link'))`

Here is a full list of extra options that you can put in the array:

- decorate - Add bold, italic and marked text
- link - Add links
- ul - Add unordered lists
- ol - Add numbered lists
- dl - Add description lists
- bq - Add blockquotes
- code - Add code samples
- headers - Add headers
- allcaps - Use ALL CAPS
- prude - Prude version

# CHANGELOG

### 0.0.3

* Add `lipsum()` helper function for generating dummy lorem ipsum paragraphs.
